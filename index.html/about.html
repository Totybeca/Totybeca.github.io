    <p>Late last year I was sick, and so Iwent to the Lagos university teaching hospital
         for treatment.I discovered that the process required to get a patient's card was 
        rigorous and exhausting as they had piles of card with registration numbers written
        on them., There were so many people waiting for the clerk to look for their card
        before they could see a doctor,  and those that were coming for the first time 
        like me were asked to wait first, it took the whole day before about 200 peopleâ€™s 
        cards were found and the others were asked to cme in another time. I ended up not 
        seeing a doctor and i was given an appointment for another 3 months.so i thought 
        of a better way to make this easy and fast. And that was where the idea of patient
        record system came in.</p>
